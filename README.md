Base classes for designing experiments using Python 

To begin, install `python 2.7` using `anaconda` via the following [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).

Create a new development environment within `anaconda` called `pyschopy`, and install the `psychopy` libraries and its required dependencies:

```
conda create -n psychopy --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/CogSci psychopy pyglet wxpython pygame python=2.7
```
